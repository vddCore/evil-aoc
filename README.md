### evil-aoc
Solutions to Advent of Code as a means to test my language and virtual machine, [EVIL](https://github.com/vddCore/EVIL).

#### How to run solutions
1. Grab an [artifact](https://github.com/vddCore/EVIL/actions), extract it somewhere on your system. You need .NET >= 7.0 to run this. Optionally, add the directory to your `$PATH`.
2. Execute one of the solutions (assumes `evil` in `$PATH`), e.g. `evil /path/to/aoc/2015/d12.vil`

> **NOTE**  
> Some solutions will run for quite a while because the VM is slow as shit. Maybe I should re-write the entire thing in C one day... And make a JIT. Who knows.

> After 3 years I'm just tired of this project so if all you wanna bitch about is the performance/implementation details *leave me alone*.
